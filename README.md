Data Analysis with Titanic Dataset
Description
This project involves data analysis using the Titanic dataset. In this project, we categorize the passengers by age and analyze the relationship between age category and the class of service on the Titanic.

Tasks
Age Categorization:

We divided the passengers' ages into 6 categories:

Infants: 0–2 years
Children: 3–12 years
Teenagers: 13–17 years
Youth: 18–25 years
Adults: 26–60 years
Elderly: 61 years and older

Analyzing the Relationship Between Age and Class:

We performed an analysis to check if there is an association between the passengers' age category and the class they are traveling in, using the Chi-square test.

Grouping and Pivot Table:

We calculated the number of passengers in each age category by class. A pivot table was created, with classes on the X-axis, age categories on the Y-axis, and the count of passengers in each category at the intersections.
